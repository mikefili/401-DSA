# Trees

## Data Structure
A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

## Depth First Traversal Methods
- PreOrder: returns an array of values, starting with the root 
- InOrder: returns an array of values, starting from the furthest leaf to the left with the root in the middle
- PostOrder: returns an array of values, ending with the root

## Approach & Efficiency (Big O)
1. PreOrder:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(h)

2. InOrder:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(h)

3. PostOrder:
	- Time: O(n)
	- Space: O(h)
