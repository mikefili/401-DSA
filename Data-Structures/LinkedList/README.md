# Linked List

## Data Structure
A Linked List is a linear data structure which consists of a group of nodes in a sequence. Each node contains a reference to the Next node in the list, with the final node's reference being null.

## Approach & Efficiency (Big O)
1.  Create Linked List - Time = O(1) // Space = O(1)
2.  Insert Method - Time = O(1) // Space = O(1)
3.  Includes Method - Time = O(n) // Space = O(1)
4.  Print Method - Time = O(n) // Space = O(1)
5.  Append Method - Time = O(n) // Space = O(1)
6.  InsertBefore Method - Time = 0(n) // Space = O(1)
7.  InsertAfter Method - Time = O(n) // Space = O(1)
