# Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algortithm that iterates through an array and sorts each index on each iteration resulting in a sorted array.

## Challenge
Write a function for insertion sort that takes in an unsorted array and returns the array sorted using insertion sort.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Time: O(n) since we have to iterate through all n indexes in the given array
- Space: O(1) since we aren't creating anything, just modifying an existing array
