# Queue With Stacks

## Challenge
- Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement the standard queue interface, but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:
    - enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
    - dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
-The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

## Approach & Efficiency
1.  Big O Time = O(n) // Big O Space = O(h)
